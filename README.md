_Latest Release: 0.2.0 ([changelog](https://github.com/Autarc/PeerGaming/blob/master/HISTORY.md))_


## Introduction

PeerGaming is a web framework for the browser, which uses WebRTC to connect multiple clients
and allows them to communicate. It makes it easy to create & deploy your own Multiplayer game,
