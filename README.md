==========================

A Client-Side Multiplayer Gaming Framework for the Web.

_Latest Release: 0.3.1 ([changelog](https://github.com/PeerGaming/peergaming/blob/master/HISTORY.md))_


## Introduction

PeerGaming is a web framework for the browser, which uses WebRTC to connect multiple clients
and allows them to communicate. It makes it easy to create & deploy your own Multiplayer game,
as no additional server component is required.

pg.channel( function ( channel ) {

  channel.on( 'enter', function( user ) {

    console.log( '[entered] User: ' + user.account.name + ' - Channel: ' + channel.id  + ' ]');
  });

});
